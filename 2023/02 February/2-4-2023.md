# Events:
## Morning:
- Got up, went to work
- No breakfast, been really full after eating a bowl on break so I just use that as brunch
- Really cold on the way to work today

## Work:
- Worked 7-3.
- Flipped chips as normal
- Served on the line at tortilla station
- Fairly normal shift
- Jewlia came to visit and got a chicken quesadilla, but I forgot to tell Armando she was my girlfriend so she had to pay for it

## Workout:
- Skipped because Jewlia was in town

## Evening:
- Got groceries with Jewlia, bought her a rose and a vase
- Cristian and Vilma invited us to dinner so Vilma and Jewlia could meet. Went to Burger Stand and they hit it off really well! They're already planning time to hang out and check out Ulta beauty
- Had a snack before they invited us though so we were both really full at dinner and didn't eat a whole bunch, just saved it for later

# Wins:
- Getting faster at flipping chips
- Helped steer the conversation so Jewlia had points to jump in at and relate to Vilma

# Losses:
- Big baller day, nothing really to complain about B)

# Plans:
- Gonna do my long run tomorrow after work

# Ideas:
- Add more metal to my work playlist

# Media:
- Didn't watch or read anything, just worked and spent time with Jewlia
