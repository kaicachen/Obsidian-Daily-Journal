# Events:
## Morning:
- Went on a 60 minute run at around 8 minute pace, but around the 45 minute mark Lupita called me in to work to cover for some people that called out.
- Ended up working from around 10-12.

## Classes:
- EECS 388 Lecture:
	- Don't remember much, so it must have been pretty routine and boring.
- EECS 348 Lecture:
	- Same, probably pretty routine.

## Workout:
- 60 minute run ended up being around 50 minutes for 6 miles at 8:25/mi pace. Felt really easy and calm, kinda like these longer, slower runs.

## Evening:
- I really don't remember much of this day, this week has been really busy and stressful.

# Wins:
- Did a nice easy run I guess.
- Survived getting called in to work.
